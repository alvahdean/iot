# .NET Core IoT Libraries

.NET Core can be used to build applications for [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) devices and scenarios. IoT applications typically interact with sensors, displays and input devices that require the use of [GPIO pins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output), serial ports or similar hardware.

This repository contains the [System.Device.Gpio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio) library and implementations for various boards like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Hummingboard](https://www.solid-run.com/nxp-family/hummingboard/).

The repository also contains [IoT.Device.Bindings](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Iot.Device.Bindings), a growing set of community-maintained [device bindings](src/devices/README.md) for IoT components.

**NOTE**: This repository is still in experimental stage and all APIs are subject to changes.

# How to Install

You can install the latest daily pre-release build of the .NET Core System.Device.Gpio and IoT.Device.Bindings NuGet packages from the [dotnet.myget.org feed](https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/dotnet-core/package/nuget/System.Device.Gpio).

# Contributing

Please contribute. We are primarily interested in the following:

* Improving quality and capability of the drivers for supported boards.
* Implementations for additional boards.
* [.NET device bindings](src/devices) for a wide variety of sensors, chips, displays and other components.
* Request a device binding or protocol that you need for your project ([file an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/iot/issues)).
* Links to blog posts or tweets that showcase .NET Core being used for great IoT scenarios ([file an issue](https://github.com/dotnet/iot/issues)).
