## Usage
```C#
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, (byte)I2cAddress.AddrLow);
// get I2cDevice (in Linux)
UnixI2cDevice device = new UnixI2cDevice(settings);
// get I2cDevice (in Win10)
//Windows10I2cDevice device = new Windows10I2cDevice(settings);

using (Sht3x sensor = new Sht3x(device))
{
    // read temperature (℃)
    double temperature = sensor.Temperature.Celsius;
    // read humidity (%)
    double humidity = sensor.Humidity;
    // open heater
    sensor.Heater = true;
}
```
