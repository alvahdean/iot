## Usage
```C#
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Ds3231.DefaultI2cAddress);
// get I2cDevice (in Linux)
UnixI2cDevice device = new UnixI2cDevice(settings);
// get I2cDevice (in Win10)
//Windows10I2cDevice device = new Windows10I2cDevice(settings);

using (Ds3231 rtc = new Ds3231(device))
{
    // set DS3231 time
    rtc.DateTime = DateTime.Now;
    // read time
    DateTime dt = rtc.DateTime;
    // read temperature
    double temp = rtc.Temperature.Celsius;
}
```
