## Usage
```C#
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Lm75.DefaultI2cAddress);
// get I2cDevice (in Linux)
UnixI2cDevice device = new UnixI2cDevice(settings);
// get I2cDevice (in Win10)
//Windows10I2cDevice device = new Windows10I2cDevice(settings);

using(Lm75 sensor = new Lm75(device))
{
    double temperature = sensor.Temperature.Celsius;
}
```
